Fake having a backed .NET assembly to dodge AMSI (without the need for noisy patching) by providing an implementation for IHostAssemblyStore (ala xforcered's being a good clr host) inside your inline executing bof. Also comes with (probably unstable) identity string stomping so you can run signatured stuff like Rubeus out of the box without pissing off ETW consumers. Remember - if this bof crashes so does your beacon so test in a lab with assembly first!
